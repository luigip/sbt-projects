Problem Statement
    
Warning: This problem statement contains superscripts and/or subscripts. It may not display properly outside of the applet.
 In this problem we will consider binary polynomials. A binary polynomial can be written in the following form:  P(x) = a[0] * x0 + a[1] * x1 + ... + a[n] * xn  The values a[i] are integer constants (called coefficients). For a binary polynomial we must have a[n] = 1 and each other a[i] must be either 0 or 1. The number n is called the degree of the polynomial.  Several examples:
P(x) = 1 * x0 + 0 * x1 + 1 * x2 is a binary polynomial of degree 2.
P(x) = 0 * x0 + 1 * x1 + 0 * x2 + 1 * x3 is a binary polynomial of degree 3.
P(x) = 1 * x0 is a binary polynomial of degree 0.
P(x) = 0 * x0 + 3 * x1 - 1 * x2 is not a binary polynomial, because each coefficient must be a 0 or a 1.
P(x) = 0 * x0 is not a valid binary polynomial, because the last of the values a[i] must be 1.
We can evaluate a binary polynomial for the inputs x = 0 and x = 1. In order to do so, we just have to substitute 0 or 1 for x in the above expression, compute the value of the expression and take the remainder it gives when divided by two. For example, if P(x) = 1 * x0 + 0 * x1 + 1 * x2, then P(0) = 1 * 00 + 0 * 01 + 1 * 02 = 1 and P(1) = 1 * 10 + 0 * 11 + 1 * 12 = 0 (modulo 2). Note that in this problem we assume that x0 = 1 for all x. In particular, also 00 = 1.  We call an integer x (where x is 0 or 1) a root of the binary polynomial P if P(x) = 0. You are given a binary polynomial P as the array a of its coefficients. Return the number of roots of that binary polynomial.

Examples
0)

    
{1, 0, 1}
Returns: 1
The example from the problem statement. The only root of this binary polynomial is 1.
1)

    
{0, 1, 0, 1}
Returns: 2
This is the maximum possible answer; both 0 and 1 are roots of this binary polynomial.
2)

    
{1}
Returns: 0
This binary polynomial has no roots - it always evaluates to 1.
3)

    
{1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1}
Returns: 0
